MM Side Tales 0 (ie. The Epic of Lunch Vol 1: Defamation)

Preface
-------------------

Ok, so, this is a vanity project of mine. It's made by one person and was initially made within a short span of time (3 weeks) and is being polished on the side. Source is provided but, be forewarned, it is not the most clinical or dexterous code. It’s written in C (without the plus-plus) and was intended more as an experiment in what I could do in a relatively short amount of time. So, if you don’t feel really comfortable with C code then I wouldn’t modify it. I would, however, recommend anybody the chance to freely look it over. But don’t take it as an example on how to do things properly.

It's not for the time being. I'll be checking it over more with time. With that said this is a BETA release and should be taken that way. IE. as-is.

Both of the dependent libraries contained libPlex and libmmcommon are closed source for the moment, but will eventually be released when I feel comfortable enough. They are not presentable at the moment, I’m afraid. But there’s plans in the future to release both as complete open source. As all my projects will be, they are released under the MIT license (separate file contained in this folder).

This is a microgame and likely will be fleshed out as I can make it. There will be revisions as I go along to hammer out the wonkiest aspects. The plan is to release 4 of these ‘side tales’ year by year as a precursor to the story and style of a bigger project still in development. Having the same format of a small arcade-style minigame sandwiched between 2 diorama plays.

All graphics, music, code and writing done by me. Sorry about that...

Prepackaged libraries should contain a different licenses which are provided in the same folder as they are.

HOW TO RUN:
-------------------

Linux:

	1. Make sure you acquire all dependencies (SDL2, SDL2_image, portaudio, clang)
	2. simply run “run.sh” and it should make and run the game.

* WINDOWS VERSION IS TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE *

-------------------
NOTE: feel free to check out the config_en file for configuration options. They should be self explanatory. Not all of them are yet implemented. Those that aren't are marked after the pound sign. Essentially, you just have to change the value after the '='. if it's a true/false value just type 'true' or 'false'. If it's a number type a number, etc.
-------------------

V.2.1: Small update meant to correct a few immediate release issues.

	* changed sprite theater to allow enter/return and the pressing right d-pad to change frames.
	* temporarily removed the windows version over some issues
	* no longer will you need clang to compile linux version, gcc should work fine
	* added 'deletemeafterbuild' files, these are just placeholders to make sure that certain crucial - yet empty - folders are not deleted when the repository is uploaded. You can delete these after you run the game once.
