The best of them being destined to publication in the morning. Lacking confidence in her abilities, he has assigned her an Extraplocan 5000. A world famous writing assistant who also happens to be a talking robot built out of a suitcase."

Lets start with the grandmama of them all, SQL; not to be confused with Sequel which is actually an even more ancient variation. Some people still call it that; a common misnomer. It's actually pronounced S then Q then L. Except without the \"then's\". Now, the history of Structured Query Language is very fascinating journey. You see..."
#define PLEX_LANGUAGE_INTROA_LINE67 "Pamaleana: Ok, I'll tell you the story! I was sulking one day at my then empty nest, jobless and waiting for some kind of assignment after my career aptitude points took a nosedive. I lost a custody case with my husband which was almost completely determined by said CA points. I was going to lose my home as well. That is until a man came to my door knocking. He served me papers. There had been a second lawsuit laid upon my feet from the deadbeat. This time, he wanted to take my name. I would have just become Pamaleana Codelli."

#define PLEX_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE13 "Director: As you can see, I'm not working with the brightest of minds here. Now, Miss Barfton, I'm very intrigued by your proposal here. You say that you want to do an experimental theater in a sleazy motel room with the greatest method actor in the known world, right?"

#define PLEX_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE14 "Pameleana: The greatest, you could slam a tin baseball bat square into his groin and he wouldn't break character. Feel free to give it a try during the performance, as many times as it takes to convince of his genius. The only thing he hates is when other people around him don't also maintain character."

#define PLEX_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE20 "Pamaleana: It's about a scorned ex-wife who tricks her deadbeat ex-husband into thinking he's going to meet up with a supermodel for a one night stand. Instead it ends up being a ruse to trap him in a place where she can embarrass him and force him to hash out their post-marital issues..."

#define PLEX_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE21 "Director: ...and then the motel is sieged by terrorists?"

#define PLEX_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE22 "Pamaleana: Yes, and your guys will play the terrorists. I am co-starring as his ex."

#define PLEX_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE27 "Director: Yes, they are all sniveling caffeine addicts and coffee is on short supply around here."

#define PLEX_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE28 "Pamaleana: Ok so you want me to get them coffee?"

#define PLEX_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE29 "Director: No, we have coffee in the break room. It's just... It's just this dreadful crew always wait until they're rehearsing then sneak in. They steal all our coffee. If we begin rehearsing this script then we're doomed. They'll be in a pile snoozing before the break even starts."

#define PLEX_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE30 "Pamaleana: Now that is something I can empathize. I'll tell you what, I don't need to rehearse this script, I wrote it. If you want, I'll make sure that the crew doesn't steal any more of that delicious coffee."
